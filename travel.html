    <h2>Geographical Location</h2>
    <p>On March 1, 1872, Yellowstone became the first national park for all to enjoy the unique hydrothermal and geologic features. Within Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres, visitors have unparalleled opportunities to observe wildlife in an intact ecosystem, explore geothermal areas that contain about half the worldâ€™s active geysers, and view geologic wonders like the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone River.    </p>
    <p>n winter, most roads are only open to commercially-guided snowcoach and snowmobile tours. The road between the North and Northeast entrances is open to regular vehicles year-round.</p>
